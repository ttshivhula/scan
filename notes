/* UDP PACKETS SHOULD FOLLOW
THIS FOMART, Well in theory,
i haven't tested
this but it kinda makes sense,
Fill ip header with IPPROTO_UDP
and then on the same buff move
it by 20 bytes and then populate
the udp checksum then send buffer
to the dest host and hopefully get
a reply. Ok fuck me 😏*/

struct iphdr	*iph;
	struct udphdr	*udph;

	iph = (struct iphdr *)(buff);
	udph = (struct udphdr *)(buff + (iph->ihl * 4));

	udph->source = htons((unsigned short)sport);
	udph->dest = htons(dport);
	udph->len = htons(sizeof(struct udphdr));
	udph->check = 0;
	udph->check = csum((unsigned short *)&udph, iph->ihl * 4);
